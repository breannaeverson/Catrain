<h1><cp>The Perks Of Being A Wallflower by <a href='http://authors.simonandschuster.com/Stephen-Chbosky/1843916'>Stephen Chbosky</a>.</cp></h1>

<br>
<p><cb>As this piece of writing is completly subjective, I am allowed to say that this novel is definitely one of my all time favourite pieces.</cb></p>
<p><cb>The Perks, a coming of age essential in my opinion, follows letters from the main protagonist, Charlie, to an anonymous 'friend' that he has never met to help alleviate some of his fears of starting high school. This novel is set in 1991 onwards and provides insight into the world of first loves and kisses, deciding your future, sexuality, drugs and other vices. It also deals with bullies, mental disorders, breakups, death and broken friendships.</cb></p>
<p><cb>Although never actually mentioned, it is common assumption that Charlie has something close social anxiety and other disorders that could make it harder for him to make friends, especially after having so much difficulty coping with the suicide of his best friend leaving him with no one. Charlie excells at his school work but lacks required social skills and after only making one friend on the first day- his english teacher- he then meets seniors Sam and Patrick and their friendship fluctuates throughout the novel.</cb></p>
<p><cb>As you could probably tell I could tell you about the whole plot in immense detail I've read it that many times, so I must stop here and let you discover the rest of the amazing novel that is The Perks Of Being A Wallflower.</cb></p>
<br>
<p><cb>And on a final note, you can watch the trailer for the movie adaptation <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5rh7O4IDc0'>here</a>.</cb></p>
