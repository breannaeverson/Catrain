<h1><cb>The Fault In Our Stars by <a href='http://johngreenbooks.com/'>John Green</a>. </cb></h1>

<p><cb>A few weeks ago, I read the book The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. As any book written by John Green is bound to be amazing, this was no disappointment.</cb></p>

<p><cb>This book is mainly about a teenage girl, called Hazel Grace, who is struggling with cancer and has been for a while. Hazel Grace is at a cancer support group and meets a guy called Augustus who comes along because he is friends with Isaac, who regularly attends and is about to lose his eyesight to cancer. Augustus turns out to be another main character of the book. Hazel finds out that Augustus also had cancer; it resulted in his leg being amputated. However, this does not stop him from enjoying his life to the full.</cb></p>

<p><cb>As the book progresses, Hazel Grace introduces Gus to a book that they both obsess over. They want to visit the author in Amsterdam, and because of cancer wishes, they think they are able to. But until Hazel tells him, Augustus doesn't know that she had already spent her wish a few years ago, for a trip to Disneyland. But Gus being the great person he is, spends his wish on a trip to Amsterdam, taking Hazel Grace and her mum with him.</cb></p>

<p><cb>The Fault In Our Stars came out as a film adaptation in the June of 2014 -- starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, it is definitely not a film to miss.</cb></p>

<p><cb>I will not spoil the ending, but be prepared - it is not what you would expect. John Green has done an amazing job writing this novel, and whether you are male or female, it is a great read for both. As the cover of the book says, "You laugh, you cry, and then you come back for more.".</cb></p>
