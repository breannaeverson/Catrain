<h1><cp>As Red As Blood by <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salla_Simukka'>Salla Simukka</a>. </cp></h1>
<p><cb>by <a href='about.html'>Breanna Everson</a>.</cb></p>
<br>
<p><cb> Red As Blood by Salla Simukka, a best selling Finnish author, is the first in a trilogy and depicting the story of seventeen year old Lumikki Andersson, a normal girl who doesn’t really fit in at her school and keeps to herself. Within the first few chapters Lumikki stumbles upon a bag filled of blood soaked money hanging in her school’s dark room. One of Lumikki’s main life rules is to stay out of anything and everything that she’s not directly involved in, and she’s not. Yet.</cb></p>

<p><cb>But what to do with the money?</cb></p>

<p><cb>After a series of events Lumikki finds herself neck deep in something she should have never been apart of and takes risks that could possibly even end her life. As Red As Blood was and excellent chilling tale of crime and conspiracy that was definitely hard to put down. I would highly suggest this book to anyone who likes a good read in the crime genre as they would hopefully love it as much as I did.</cb></p>
